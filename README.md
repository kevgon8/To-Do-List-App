# To Do List App

## Description
This project was created as part of the selection round for the SRM ACM Student Chapter club in my college. It consists of two versions of a To-Do List application:

1. A **GUI-based version** built using Python, Tkinter, and ttkbootstrap.
2. A **Terminal-based version** that runs entirely in the command-line interface (CLI).

Both versions allow users to add, view, and manage tasks, but each provides a different user experience based on preference.

### Features
- **Simple CLI Interface**: Users can add, view, and mark tasks as completed directly from the terminal.
- **Task Saving**: Tasks are saved in a text file with an easy-to-read format.
- **Cross-Platform**: The terminal version works across any system that supports Python.

### Installation
Follow the same steps as the GUI version for installation.

### Usage
To run the terminal-based To-Do List app:

```bash
python todo_cli.py
```
1. **Add Tasks**: Select option 1, enter tasks, and press Ctrl-Z to stop adding tasks.
2. **View Tasks**: Select option 2 to display the list of tasks.

3. **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Enter the number of the task you have completed to mark it as done. Completed tasks will be marked with an [X].

## Known Issues
- **GUI Progress Alignment**: The progress bar may occasionally have alignment issues.
- **Terminal Task Number Validation**: The terminal version may not handle invalid task numbers properly.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core language used for both versions.
- **Tkinter**: Used for creating the GUI version.
- **ttkbootstrap**: Adds modern themes and styles to the GUI version.
- **Terminal/CLI**: Used for the terminal version for simple user interaction.

## Future Improvements
- **GUI Enhancements**: Include the ability to edit tasks and switch between different colour themes.
- **Terminal Version Improvements**: Add better input validation for task numbering and additional features like task deletion.
